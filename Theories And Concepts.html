            <h1>Theories And Concepts</h1>
            <p>Explore the fascinating theories and concepts that shape our understanding of parallel universes.</p>

                <h2>Many - Worlds Interpretation</h2>
                <img src="images/Many - Worlds_Interpretation.png"">
                <p>The Many-Worlds Interpretation (MWI) of quantum mechanics proposes that every possible outcome of a
                    quantum event actually occurs, resulting in a branching of the universe into multiple, parallel
                    worlds. Each branch represents a different reality where different events have taken place. This
                    interpretation, introduced by Hugh Everett in 1957, eliminates the need for wave function collapse
                    and suggests that all possible states exist simultaneously in a vast multiverse. MWI provides a
                    compelling explanation for the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and opens up intriguing
                    possibilities for the existence of parallel universes. </p>

                <h2>String Theory</h2>
                <img src="images/string_theory.png">
                <p>String theory suggests that the fundamental particles of the universe are one-dimensional "strings"
                    that vibrate at different frequencies. This theory not only aims to unify all fundamental forces but
                    also implies the existence of multiple dimensions beyond the familiar three. These extra dimensions
                    could potentially host parallel universes, each with its own unique physical laws and properties.
                    Thus, string theory provides a fascinating framework for the possibility of parallel realms,
                    expanding our understanding of the cosmos and the nature of reality.</p>

                <h2>Inflationary Mutliverse</h2>
                <img src="images/inflationary.png">
                <p>The Inflationary Multiverse theory arises from the concept of eternal inflation, which suggests that
                    the rapid expansion of the universe after the Big Bang continues indefinitely in various regions.
                    This ongoing inflation creates "bubble universes," each with its own distinct physical properties
                    and laws. Our observable universe is just one of these bubbles where inflation has stopped, allowing
                    for the formation of stars and galaxies. This theory implies the existence of a vast multiverse,
                    with countless parallel universes coexisting, each potentially vastly different from our own.</p>

                    Wormholes
                </h2>
                <img src="images/wormhole.png">
                <p>Wormholes are hypothetical tunnels that connect distant points in space-time, potentially allowing
                    for faster-than-light travel and even time travel. Based on solutions to Einstein's field equations
                    in general relativity, wormholes can be visualized as shortcuts through the fabric of space-time.
                    While they remain theoretical and have not been observed, wormholes are a popular concept in both
                    scientific research and science fiction. They offer intriguing possibilities for exploring parallel
                    universes, as traveling through a wormhole could theoretically lead to entirely different regions of
                    the cosmos or even alternate realities.</p>
